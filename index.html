              <h5>Important job specs:</h5>
              <p>These must be read for every job. Customers can change these requirements from job-to-job, so they must be read for each job. If you only want to review the job specs marked as important, you can click the 'only show important' button to only show a list of important instructions.</p>
              <h5>Job spec sections:</h5>
              <p>These sections group the job specs into logical blocks. For example, if you see something on-screen, then you will likely need to look at the Visual section. If you hear something, you will likely need to look at the Audio section.</p>
              <h5>Key:</h5>
              <p>The key informs you what the different colours mean. For example, green instructions are style guides that inform you how to type something.</p>
              <h5>Something not here?</h5>
              <p>The Job Specs communicate the requirements of the customer for this particular job. If you need to find out how the software works, it will likely be in the software's manual. If you have a question related to working for Vitac in general, then it is probably in the general working practices document.</p>

                          <p>Archive is often used by documentaries about historic events, sometimes the only way to get authentic footage of a real life event is to use footage from an archive collection.</p>
                          <p>Footage from previous episodes of the same programme is considered as archive. This is because it was footage recorded for a previous show and is therefore considered as borrowing from an archive collection.</p>

It only needs to be logged when the reconstruction is found on a media file with 'real life' footage (usually interviews with the persons involved. If the entirety of the media consists of dramatizations of real life events (e.g. a film like the King's Speech) then there is no need to log reconstruction as it is assumed.</p>
                          <p>Reconstruction consists of artificial scenes of an event which have been reconstructed and acted out on film based on information of the event. Reconstructions generally provide factual information, and give the viewer a sense of realism, as if the event really happened in front of them live. They often indicate that the footage is not real by using techniques such as blurring, distortion, lighting effects, changes in camera level, and colour enhancement within the footage.</p>

It keeps track of when things are said and helps the TV editor put the programme together. Our job is to put timecodes into our script.

Instead of typing the timecode manually, shortcut keys can be used to stamp it automatically into the transcript.

This will enable the software's timecode shortcuts.</p><p>Some media files calibrate automatically, meaning that they do not need to be manually calibrated.</p><p>Some media files do not calibrate automatically, nor do they have timecode onscreen, so specific instructions for that job should be followed to calibrate the media file.</p></td>

The main title is the name of the production. Note that in TV, each season might have its own name - these are <strong>not</strong> episode titles. Instead, <strong>episode titles are individual names for each episode</strong>.</p><p> For example: a David Attenborough documentary called Planet Earth ran for two seasons. The first season's main title was Planet Earth, and the second season's main title was Planet Earth II. Each episode had its own individual title, such as Islands, Mountains, Jungles, etc. These individual titles are Episode Titles and should be logged each time they appear onscreen.</p><p/><h1>Examples</h1><ul><li>Friends: The One Where Ross and Rachel Take a Break</li><li>The Simpsons: Treehouse of Horror IV</li><li>Only Fools and Horses: Heroes and Villains</li></ul><p/><h1>Tips</h1><strong>TIP:</strong> Episode Titles are often found near the opening credits, as part of the title sequence, or at the very start of the show.<p><strong>TIP:</strong> Note that some TV shows might have more than one episode per transcript and thus have two different Episode Titles per script. This is common in kids TV programmes where the stories are shorter to keep their viewer's attention. Both Episode Titles should be logged.</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> An Episode Title may appear alongside the Main Title. When this happens, the Episode Title is logged separately to the Main Title with their own Visual Events.</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Episode titles are mentioned in the clock screen before the start of the programme. This should not be logged as an episode title, but instead just included as part of the clock screen visual event.</p><p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Not to be confused with the name of the entire series. The episode title is a sub heading for a specific episode from a wider series. </p></td>

                          <p>A graphic text event is usually made up of multiple graphical text entries, and is usually more complex than a simple caption. Here is a checklist that will help decide if the text on screen is is Graphics Text:</p>

                            <li>Does the visual event have text?</li>

                          <p>If the answer to both is 'yes', then it is probably Graphic Text.</p>

                          <ul>
                            <li>A countdown timer is Graphic Text. The numbers counting down indicate a change of time. This text is 'developing'.</li>
                            <li>A bidding counter at an auction is Graphic Text. The money counting up indicates a change in the bidding amount. This text is 'developing'.</li>
                            <li>A map <em>might</em> contain Graphics Text, but it depends on how the text <strong>develops</strong>:<ul>	<li>If there are only a few locations labelled on the map, then it can probably be typed out in full as a <strong>Caption</strong>.</li><li>If the map develops to move from one location to another, or there are lots of location names popping up on the map, then the text on the map probably needs to be described in a Graphi Text visual event. This is because the text is 'developing' and needs more than just the locations to be copy typed.</li></ul></li>
                            <li>A scientific diagram <em>might</em> be Graphic Text, but it depends on how the text <strong>develops</strong>:<ul><li>If there is a very complicated diagram of a space station, but just a single piece of text indicating that this is a 'space station', then this is a <strong>Caption</strong>.</li><li>If this very same diagram contains lots of text explaining all the sections of the space station, and it is appearing so quickly that it is hard to keep up, then it probably needs to be logged as <strong>Graphic Text</strong>. Again, this text is 'developing'.</li>	</ul></li>

You are probably familiar with a few famous title sequences, such as the openings to Eastenders, Coronation Street, BBC News, Match of the Day and Who Wants to be a Millionaire? All of which have a famous soundtrack and series of shots that lead up to the title of the show. Many shows use this opportunity to introduce cast members or locations that appear in the programme.</p>

                            <li>If you have been asked to transcribe opening credits, you should include opening credits that occur during title sequences by logging them in their own visual event(s).</li>

Often, it is used when there is sequential footage of people talking about a subject, combined (cut with) with footage of said subject.

                          <p>The aim is to log what is happening onscreen and not to log what is being said. Descriptions should consist of what can be seen, not what can be heard. For example, avoid logs like: </p>
                          <p><strong>SHOT:</strong> Jamie Oliver talking about how bread rises whilst he kneads dough.</p>
                          <p>Instead, the descriptions should log what can be seen:</p>
                          <p><strong>SHOT:</strong> Jamie Oliver talking whilst kneading dough.</p>
                          <p>NOTE: Programmes like chat shows, comedy stand-up, and concerts do not have a lot of shot variations. For that reason, this rule can be broken to give a bit of variation to the shot descriptions. Using the topics in the dialogue or the song being performed can be used to group shots. For example:</p>
                          <p> <strong>SEQUENCE:</strong> Radiohead look sombre whilst they play the intro to 'Creep'</p>
                          <p>Or:</p>
                          <p><strong>SEQUENCE:</strong> Graham Norton laughing whilst talking to Lady Gaga about her choice of wardrobe.</p>

                          <p>It can be difficult to know if you should or shouldn't be grouping shots by quantity. Every programme is different, so the approach may need to be adapted from script to script.</p>
                          <p>Grouping too much: When a grouping goes on for more than thirty seconds, perhaps the group should be split it up into two groups? Often a sequence or a montage will develop to help tell a story, use the developments in the subject/theme to split up the shots and provide a little more detail in the descriptions.</p>
                          <p>It is difficult to group shots: Not every programme lends itself to grouping shots by quantity and it may be more suitable to log each shot individually.</p>
                          <p>Again, not every programme is the same, therefore the grouping style may need to be adapted from job-to-job.</p>

                          <p>Apostrophes are used to show that something belongs to someone or something else. For example:</p>

                            <li>Alice's coat (the coat belonging to Alice)</li>

                          </ul>
                          <p>Add an apostrophe and an s ('s) to singular nouns and plural nouns that don't end in s, such as children and people. For example:</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>the dog's dinner</li>
                            <li>the children's play area</li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>Just add an apostrophe to plural nouns that already end in s. For example:</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>ladies' room</li>
                            <li>parents' evening</li>
                          </ul>
                          <p><em>Never</em> use an apostrophe to indicate a plural. This also applies to initials, abbreviations and numbers. For example:</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>DVDs</li>
                            <li>1990s</li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>An apostrophe is used in contractions to indicate that something is missing. For example:</p>
                          <ul>

                          <p>A source script should have been provided, and it must be used.</p>
                          <p>Support material is provided to us by the client, it is not created by Vitac.</p>
                          <p>Support material can come in many forms, such as a credits list, contributor list, or a glossary of terms. However, the most common type of support material provided for post-edit jobs is the source script.</p>
                          <p>Source scripts are commonly available for scripted shows, but are rarely available for reality / documentary shows. If a source script has been provided, this is particularly useful for finding key names, phrases, and hard-to-hear dialogue. Try to follow the source script whilst typing the script, and unless you are instructed otherwise, you must follow the speaker name format. E.g. If Job Bloggs has the speaker label "Bloggs" in the source script, you must use this speaker name in your own script.</p>
                          <p>If support material has been provided, the client expects it to be visible and referred to whilst typing the script.</p>
